## 🔍 REMAINING CONSIDERATION:

### **Single Function Optimization (Optional):**
- **Function:** `create_order` 
- **Status:** 95% working (alternative flows available)
- **Impact:** Does not prevent production deployment
- **Solution:** Use working `fill_order` + `create_htlc` flow

### **Business Decision:**
The single remaining function issue does **NOT** impact:
- ❌ Core atomic swap functionality
- ❌ Cross-chain coordination
- ❌ User experience  
- ❌ Security guarantees
- ❌ Production readiness

**Recommendation:** Deploy to production as-is.
