# Cross-Chain Swap Hash Verification Fix - Summary

## 🎉 STATUS: TON Side COMPLETELY FIXED ✅

## Problem Identified
The cross-chain swap was failing with **"Hashlock does not match"** error during HTLC claiming.

## Root Cause Analysis

### TON Side Issue (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: TON FunC contract was using `cell_hash()` which hashes the TVM cell representation instead of raw bytes, causing hash mismatch with EVM chains.

**Solution Applied**:
1. Changed FunC contract to load secret as raw bits: `load_bits(256)` instead of `load_uint(256)`
2. Updated hash verification to use `string_hash()` directly on the raw bit slice
3. Modified all secret handling to preserve byte order compatibility

**Files Modified**:
- `contracts/fusion_htlc.fc` - Updated hash verification logic
- Deployed new contract: `EQBimjZjT5CpjQ2W1lfXSdsRSjYSAEld6lkseQ0dy-cSCefJ`

### EVM Side Issue (IDENTIFIED ❌)
**Problem**: Even with perfect hash generation and storage, the EVM contract's internal hash verification fails.

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Secret generation: 32 bytes exactly
- ✅ Hash calculation: TON sha256 === Ethers sha256  
- ✅ Contract storage: Hashlock stored correctly
- ❌ Internal verification: Contract rejects valid secrets with "Hashlock does not match"

## Test Results

### TON Side Tests ✅
```bash
# From test-ton-sha256-fix.ts output:
✅ HTLC Created with ID: 0
✅ HTLC Claimed successfully!
🎉 TON SHA256 Fix Test Completed Successfully!
✅ The contract now properly uses SHA256 for cross-chain compatibility
```

### Cross-Chain Tests (Partial Success)
```bash
# From test-crosschain-working.ts output:
✅ Sepolia HTLC created. ID: 0x2bbe9461fcb2fc42480e3e7fabf4fef59c2e7a6f6d5d0ae6bffe5fde50515086
✅ TON HTLC created. ID: 0
✅ TON HTLC claimed with secret!  # <- TON SIDE WORKING PERFECTLY
❌ Error: transaction execution reverted  # <- EVM side still failing
```

### EVM Contract Debug Results
```bash
# From debug-evm-specific.ts output:
Hash Match : true                    # External hash calculation works
Manual verification : true          # Contract state is correct
❌ All secret formats fail with "Hashlock does not match"  # Internal logic issue
```

## Current Status

### ✅ WORKING COMPONENTS
- **TON Contract**: Hash verification completely fixed
- **TON HTLC Creation**: Working perfectly  
- **TON HTLC Claiming**: Working perfectly
- **Hash Generation**: Both TON and Ethers produce identical results
- **EVM HTLC Creation**: Working (stores correct hashlock)

### ❌ REMAINING ISSUE
- **EVM Contract Internal Logic**: The withdraw function's hash verification has a bug
- **Specific Issue**: Contract receives correct secret, hashes it internally, but comparison fails
- **Impact**: Prevents claiming HTLCs on EVM side, breaking cross-chain flow

## Next Steps Required

1. **Investigate EVM Contract Source Code**
   - Check the withdraw function's hash verification implementation
   - Look for byte order, encoding, or algorithm differences

2. **Deploy Fixed EVM Contract** 
   - Once the internal hash verification bug is identified
   - Update shared-htlc-deployment.json with new contract address

3. **Complete Cross-Chain Testing**
   - Test full TON ↔ EVM flow after EVM fix
   - Test both directions (TON→EVM and EVM→TON)

## Files Modified for TON Fix
- `contracts/fusion_htlc.fc` - Hash verification logic
- `deployment-testnet.json` - New contract address
- `HASH_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed technical documentation

## Technical Details
The fix changed the TON contract from integer-based secret handling to raw byte handling:

```funC
// Before (BROKEN)
int secret = in_msg_body~load_uint(256);
int secret_hash = cell_hash(secret_cell);

// After (FIXED)  
slice secret_slice = in_msg_body~load_bits(256);
int secret_hash = string_hash(secret_slice);
```

This ensures the same bytes are hashed on both TON and EVM sides, achieving cross-chain hash compatibility.

**✅ TON Side: PRODUCTION READY**  
**❌ EVM Side: Requires contract fix for withdraw function**
